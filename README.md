### Hi

My name is Tim Fennis, and I'm currently employed as a backend endgineer by the Dutch public news broadcaster NOS. 

My public repositories mostly consist of my Advent of Code puzzle solutions.

 - **[2022](https://github.com/timfennis/advent-of-code-2022) 🦀 Rust & 🐍 Sneklang**
 - [2021](https://github.com/timfennis/advent-of-code-2021) 🏝️ Kotlin
 - [2020 WIP](https://github.com/timfennis/advent-of-code-2020) Haskell
 - [2016 WIP](https://github.com/timfennis/advent-of-code-2026) 🐍 Sneklang
 - [2015 WIP](https://github.com/timfennis/advent-of-code-2026) 🦀 Rust
 
 I also wrote a (now) horribly outdated library for [functional programming in PHP](https://github.com/timfennis/apply).
